# Diary

Diary web application using NextJS.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
  - This will also install `npm`, make sure both are added to the `path` and available in terminal.
  - It is a good idea to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to manage NodeJS. It can easily help to switch NodeJS versions when working in multiple repositories.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - To commit changes, can be skipped if you just want to check out the app.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  - Faster and more robust package manager than `npm`.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Other IDE can be used of course, but there are added settings for VSCode in the project.
  - Once the project is opened in VSCode, install the recommended extensions.

## Development

1. Install required dependencies with `pnpm i`.
2. Start the app with `pnpm dev`.

There are of course more scripts available, check out the [package.json](./package.json) for more information.
